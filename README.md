# Bayesian-analyses

### Content

This repository contains some scripts that I developed for the implementation of bayesian models
for genetic assesment.

#### 1. Multiple-trait model through Bayesian inference applied to Jatropha curcas breeding for bioenergy

Multitrait model for genetic assesment in jathropha curcas. We implemented the multitrait analyses, calculated the genetic and phenotypic correlation using bayesian approach (MCMC) for selection.
