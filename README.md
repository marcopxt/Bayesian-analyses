# Bayesian-analyses

### Content

This repository contains some scripts that I developed for the implementation of bayesian models
for genetic assesment. In both cases I used the R package MCMCglmm (Hadfield 2010).

#### 1. Multiple-trait model through Bayesian inference applied to Jatropha curcas breeding for bioenergy

Multitrait model for genetic assesment in jathropha curcas. We implemented the multitrait analyses, calculated the genetic and phenotypic correlation using bayesian approach (MCMC) for selection.

#### 2. Multitrait and multiharvest analyses for genetic assessment and selection of Tahiti acid lime genotypes through Bayesian inference

Multitrait mixed models implemented at the bayesian framework to selection superior genotypes of tahiti acid lime considering different traits and selection indexes.

Any question about the analyses, please, contact me!
